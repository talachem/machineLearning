# machineLearning

A wholistic machine learning framework written in python with numpy.

This includes different neural network layers, decision trees and forests and self organizing maps.

Everything here has a more modular approach, inspired by PyTorch.

This is more of an academy library, inorder for me to learn how ML actually works and not how different applications are imnplemented.
